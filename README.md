This HTML code creates a basic layout for a job board website with a header, nav bar, and three sections for featured jobs, job categories, and companies. You can customize the content and styles of each element using CSS and JavaScript.

This CSS code styles the header, nav bar, and footer with colors and fonts, and it also styles the main content area with flexbox layout to display the three sections side by side. You can customize the styles further to suit your needs.

To use this CSS with your HTML, you can add it to a style element in the head of your HTML document, or you can link to an external CSS file using the link element.
